        <p class="mb-6">We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. I'm a water fanatic. I love water.</p>
        <p class="mb-6">Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. It takes dark in order to show light.</p>
        <p class="mb-6">It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? A big strong tree needs big strong roots. I like to beat the brush. Zip. That easy.</p>
        <p class="mb-6">We need dark in order to show light. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? Let's do it again then, what the heck. The light is your friend. Preserve it.</p>
        <p class="mb-6">Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky.</p>
        <p class="mb-6">And right there you got an almighty cloud. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. This is gonna be a happy little seascape.</p>
        <p class="mb-6">Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. We don't have anything but happy trees here. Let's have a happy little tree in here. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds.</p>

            <p class="mb-6">Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there.</p>
            <p class="mb-6">Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? Anyone can paint. Trees cover up a multitude of sins. Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them.</p>
            <p class="mb-6">And maybe, maybe, maybe... I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. I'm a water fanatic. I love water. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day.</p>
            <p class="mb-6">Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. Get tough with it, get strong. We'll make some happy little bushes here. Put it in, leave it alone.</p>
            <p class="mb-6">Let's have a nice tree right here. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. We'll play with clouds today. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so.</p>
            <p class="mb-6">You have to make those little noises or it won't work. If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. Let's have a happy little tree in here. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world.</p>

            <p class="mb-6">In life you need colors. Everybody needs a friend. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness.</p>

            <p class="mb-6">We need dark in order to show light. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. Just make little strokes like that. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. Anyone can paint. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything.</p>
            <a class="underline text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 visited:text-purple-600" href="/">Go home</a>
            <p class="mb-6">Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy. Get tough with it, get strong. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. Just beat the devil out of it. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit.</p>
            <p class="mb-6">If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. Let's just drop a little Evergreen right here. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. We wash our brush with odorless thinner. I'm a water fanatic. I love water. Take your time. Speed will come later.</p>
            <p class="mb-6">We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. Itâ€™s about to freeze me to death. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. You have to make those little noises or it won't work. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. Play with the angles. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents.</p>
            <p class="mb-6">Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. We need a shadow side and a highlight side. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. It's important to me that you're happy. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. All those little son of a guns. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play.</p>
            <p class="mb-6">Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. It's cold, but it's beautiful. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. You have to make these big decisions. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. You are only limited by your imagination. We'll have a super time. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world.</p>
            <p class="mb-6">You're meant to have fun in life. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. And right there you got an almighty cloud.</p>
